## Features
- Real-time monitoring of driver alertness.
- Alerts the driver when drowsiness is detected.
- Utilizes advanced computer vision techniques for accurate detection.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV for image processing.
  - TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning.
  - NumPy for numerical operations.
  - Matplotlib for data visualization.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/driver-drowsiness-detector.git
   cd driver-drowsiness-detector

Install required packages:
Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Download the pre-trained model (if applicable):
If your project uses a pre-trained model, ensure it is downloaded and placed in the appropriate directory.
Usage
To run the Driver Drowsiness Detector, execute the following command in your terminal:
bash
python main.py

Make sure your webcam is enabled, as the application will use it to monitor the driver's face.
Example Command:
bash
python main.py --video 0

This command uses the default webcam (video source 0). You can replace 0 with a video file path if you wish to test with recorded footage.
